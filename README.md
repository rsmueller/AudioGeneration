# AudioGeneration
Java classes and project(s) for generating audio. 
A particular goal of this project is to emulate sound
form common instruments like drums or piano.

This is not mean to act as the synthesizer for audio, rather implement
the synthesizer and instruments the java api already provides into an
application that can be used by anyone.
